# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 2
This repo is for the 2nd course project work of Getting and Cleaning Data. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## Files contained in this repo
- README.md: explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected
- CodeBook.md: describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data
- run_analysis.R: the programming code which transforms and cleans up data
- CourseProject2Result.txt: the final output (in requested text format) of this course project

## Project assignments
 You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Prerequisite
You should have the source zip file "getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset.zip" under your working directory.
